Kill command can do really few things - send a specific signal, list all possible signals, and show signal information in as a table.
The main work of is done by send_signals function, which checks for pid and errors and then calls a system call on line 208 with arguments pid and signal number.
In the main function there are checks for validity of the given arguments. If everything is correct and there is no list option being called, then send_signals function is being called on the last (312th) line.
